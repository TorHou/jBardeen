This is old code that I used during my Phd. 
It is not maintained, not documented and solves something very specific. As such it is unusable.
It might help you to get an idea on how to read VASP's WAVECAR files, however. That's why I wanted to keep a copy of this code, even though it is embarassingly ugly.
